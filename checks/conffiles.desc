Tag: file-in-usr-marked-as-conffile
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.7.2
Info: All configuration files must reside in <tt>/etc</tt>.  Files below
 <tt>/usr</tt> may not be marked as conffiles since <tt>/usr</tt> might be
 mounted read-only.  The local system administrator would therefore not
 have a chance to modify this configuration file.

Tag: non-etc-file-marked-as-conffile
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: A file installed in some other directory than <tt>/etc</tt>
 is marked as conffile.  A conffile typically implies a configuration
 file, and Policy mandates such files to be in <tt>/etc</tt>.

Tag: relative-conffile
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy E.1
Info: All entries in the <tt>debian/conffiles</tt> control file should
 have an absolute path specification.

Tag: duplicate-conffile
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The file is listed more than once in your <tt>debian/conffiles</tt> file.
 Usually, this is because debhelper (dh_installdeb, compat level 3 or higher)
 will add any files in your package located in /etc automatically to the list
 of conffiles, so if you do that manually too, you'll get duplicates.

Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 10.7
Info: Files in <tt>/etc</tt> must be marked conffiles if they are included
 in a package.  Otherwise they should be created by maintainer scripts.
