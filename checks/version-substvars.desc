Check-Script: version-substvars
Author: Adeodato Sim√≥ <dato@net.com.org.es>
Abbrev: v-s
Type: source
Needs-Info: debfiles, source-control-file
Info: This script checks for correct use of the various
 <tt>*Version</tt> substvars, e.g. deprecated substvars,
 or usage that can cause un-binNMUability

Tag: not-binnmuable-any-depends-any
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:any package
 depends on another arch:any package with a (= ${source:Version})
 relationship. Please use (= ${binary:Version}) instead.

Tag: not-binnmuable-any-depends-all
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:any package
 depends on an arch:all package with a (= ${Source-Version}) or
 (= ${binary:Version}) relationship. Please use (= ${source:Version})
 instead.

Tag: not-binnmuable-all-depends-any
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:all package
 depends on an arch:any package with a strict (= ${Source-Version}), or
 similar, relationship.
 .
 It is not possible for arch:all packages to depend so strictly on
 arch:any packages while having the package binNMUable, so please use
 one of these, whichever is more appropriate:
 .
   Depends: arch_any (&gt;= ${source:Version})
   Depends: arch_any (&gt;= ${source:Version}),
    arch_any (&lt;&lt; ${source:Version}.1~)

Tag: version-substvar-for-external-package
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Info: The first package has a dependency on the second package that uses
 (= ${binary:Version}), (= ${source:Version}), or (= ${Source-Version}),
 but the second package is not built from this source package.  Usually
 this means there is a mistake in the package name in this dependency.

Tag: substvar-source-version-is-deprecated
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The package uses the now deprecated ${Source-Version} substvar,
 which has misleading semantics.  Please switch to ${binary:Version} or
 ${source:Version} as appropriate (introduced in dpkg 1.13.19, released
 with etch).  Support for ${Source-Version} may be removed from dpkg-dev
 in the future.
