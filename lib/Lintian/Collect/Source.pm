=head1 NAME

Lintian::Collect::Source - Lintian interface to source package data collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my ($name, $type) = ('foobar', 'source');
    my $collect = Lintian::Collect->new($name, $type);
    if ($collect->native) {
        print "Package is native\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Collect::Source provides an interface to package data for source
packages.  It implements data collection methods specific to source
packages.

This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data from
files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates that
data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all data about
source packages via this module so that the module can cache data where
appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of caching that
data in memory.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(PACKAGE)

Creates a new Lintian::Collect::Source object.  Currently, PACKAGE is
ignored.  Normally, this method should not be called directly, only via
the Lintian::Collect constructor.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

In addition to the instance methods listed below, all instance methods
documented in the Lintian::Collect module are also available.

=over 4

=item binaries()

Returns a hash reference with the binary package names as keys and the
Package-Type as value (which should be either C<deb> or C<udeb>
currently).  The source-control-file collection script must have been run
to parse the F<debian/control> file and put the fields in the F<control>
directory in the lab.

=item binary_field(PACKAGE, FIELD)

Returns the content of the field FIELD for the binary package PACKAGE in
the F<debian/control> file, or an empty string if that field isn't set.
Inheritance of field values from the source section of the control file is
not implemented.  Only the literal value of the field is returned.

The source-control-file collection script must have been run to parse the
F<debian/control> file and put the fields in the F<control> directory in
the lab.

=item binary_relation(PACKAGE, FIELD)

Returns a Lintian::Relation object for the specified FIELD in the binary
package PACKAGE in the F<debian/control> file.  FIELD should be one of the
possible relationship fields of a Debian package or one of the following
special values:

=over 4

=item all

The concatenation of Pre-Depends, Depends, Recommends, and Suggests.

=item strong

The concatenation of Pre-Depends and Depends.

=item weak

The concatenation of Recommends and Suggests.

=back

If FIELD isn't present in the package, the returned Lintian::Relation
object will be empty (always satisfied and implies nothing).

Any substvars in F<debian/control> will be represented in the returned
relation as packages named after the substvar.

=item changelog()

Returns the changelog of the source package as a Parse::DebianChangelog
object, or undef if the changelog is a symlink or doesn't exist.  The
debfiles collection script must have been run to create the changelog
file, which this method expects to find in F<debfiles/changelog>.

=item native()

Returns true if the source package is native and false otherwise.

=item relation(FIELD)

Returns a Lintian::Relation object for the given build relationship field
FIELD.  In addition to the normal build relationship fields, the
following special field names are supported:

=over 4

=item build-depends-all

The concatenation of Build-Depends and Build-Depends-Indep.

=item build-conflicts-all

The concatenation of Build-Conflicts and Build-Conflicts-Indep.

=back

If FIELD isn't present in the package, the returned Lintian::Relation
object will be empty (always satisfied and implies nothing).

=item relation_noarch(FIELD)

The same as relation(), but ignores architecture restrictions in the
FIELD field.
